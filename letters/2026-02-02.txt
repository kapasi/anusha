Happy 2nd of February. Today is all about resilience. You are such a symbol of commitment in the face of adversity. Your continued dedication to your studies in the face of mood changes, boredom, life events etc is something I admire about you and respect you for. You are a big inspiration to me, and I love that about you. I am your biggest cheerleader and draw so much motivation from seeing you being at it everday. You got this honey, I believe in you and love you so much
