Happy 4th of February princess. Today is about care. You care SO much about the people around you, whether it's the gentle care for anyone who is down, or the silent care of listening to me when I'm just venting/ranting, and also the angry care when you scold me to do things that we both know are just plain good for me. I am completely in awe of how you continue to show care for everyone that matters in this special hand-crafted special way to their exact needs. You're this ultra-hyper-independent types who doesn't like being taken care of too much, but actually show so much love and care for everyone around, so I hope you know that I (/we) am there for you to fall back on, if you ever feel the need of some care for yourself. I love you so much, beautiful.
