Happy 3rd of February. Today is about beauty. You, Anusha, are the most beautiful, most gorgeous woman that I want to see ALL THE TIME. You are obviously, clearly extremely beautiful physically. You have the face of a goddess, you're so incredibly graceful, and your body is so GODDAMN attractive to me; and your beauty extends to your hair that I love sniffing and your neck that I like biting and your lips that I love kissing. But to me, just as attractive is your emotional/mental beauty. You are a graceful and intelligent woman. You are poised, you are thoughtful, you know how to carry yourself and how to handle situations. You're not a "1 type of response to all situations", and you adapt to your environment, and this beauty is what I find extremely attractive. You are incredibly and completely beautiful. I love you, honey.
