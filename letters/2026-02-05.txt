Happy 5th of February dear. Today is humor. You are SO funny; enough said. But truly, you are incredibly funny, in your random one-liners, to your out of pocket jokes that could very easily get you cancelled. Peak Anusha humor is when you're ranting about something or someone who you clearly care about, but you wanna bitch about in the moment, and then you just drop the most random abbhorent lines, and you burst into laughter, absolute legendary material. You also get my sense of humor, which is such a big bonus for me, and one of the reasons I keep falling in love with you. The best, most humorous moments are those where we start of laughing about some sensible, well-crafter joke but just devolve into crazier and crazier escalations, and I'm so glad to be able to share such moments with you. You truly are extremely funny and amazing. (Sorry for the late letter)
