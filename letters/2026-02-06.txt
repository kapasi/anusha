Happy 6th of February, kween. Today is about strength of character. You speak your mind, truthfully and clearly, and you always stick by your word. There is incredible power in backing up your words with meaningful action, and you have shown that time and time again. You don't mince words either, but you are honest in a way that makes you trust whatever you are saying. You make small sacrifices to make sure you are caring towards others, but also draw firm boundaries wherever required, and that's a skill that I respect so much and want to imbibe. You may feel like things are difficult now, but I want to remind you that you have it in you to get through anything, and I'm backing you up if you ever feel down. You got this honey. I believe in you, and love you so so much.
